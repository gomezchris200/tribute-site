# tribute-site
This site is one of my first projects using HTML and CSS. It is a tribute site dedicated to Sir Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.
My main goal with this project was to play around with the different features of both HTML and CSS, as well as trying to practice semantic HTML.
